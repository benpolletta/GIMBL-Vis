### TODO

- New Features
  - image panel
  - add overlays
  - import csv
  - plot any categorical with labels
  - plot any ordinal with colormap
  - combine data
  - allow for iterative simulation
  - colorblind friendly colors
  - continous imaging from mouse cursor over points in graph
  - MDS, PCA, etc
  - gvArray data structure
  - have image panel show whats under cursor
- Bugs/Changes
  - check that meshgrid is correct
  - use refreshdata and drawnow
  - fix iterate to be correct
  - fix legend
  - pcolor knows color matching
  - play pause button
      - char(9654)
  - plot functions of variables as overlay (constant curent leak vs. Iapp)
- Analysis
  - what fraction of models have a class along a dim (2nd set of viewDim)
  - fraction of models that 
- gvArray
  - properties
    - sparsity
      - filled
        - mat binary for unique ordinal indicies
        - mat unique ordinal indicies by extra dims for nDmat
        - cell unique ordinal indicies
      - sparse
        - if small, do same as filled and fill with nans for mat and empty for cell
        - all cells if really sparse
    - data size
      - memory capable: load matfile
      - disk IO: slice matfile from mat array in v7.3 mat files
    - data types
      - ordinal
      - categorical w/index
      - nD-mat
      - nD-cell
    - metadata
      - labels for categorical, dims of nD arrays
    - methods
      - table out
      - slice by index, value, or label
